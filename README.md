# BetterMail
BetterMail is Ticket Support System. The bot allows users to either open a personalized custom ticket with a text command, or to easily open a ticket using the reaction menu. The bot requires owners/admins to run two setup commands, -supportsetup; this command adds a Support Staff role, adds permissions to said role, creates needed categories, and allows for other bot commands to be used in the server, this command is required for functionality. This command authorizes the use of the '-new' command, (useage: -new [reason]).
